\section{Insert A head here}
This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''. It is for preparing manuscript submission only, not for preparing camera-ready versions of manuscripts. Manuscripts will be typeset for publication by the journal, after they have been accepted.

By default, this template uses \texttt{biblatex} and adopts the Chicago referencing style. If you are using this template on Overleaf, Overleaf's build tool will automatically run \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{biber}. If you are compiling this template on your own local \LaTeX{} installation, please execute the following commands:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \verb|pdflatex sample|
    \item \verb|biber sample|
    \item \verb|pdflatex sample|
    \item \verb|pdflatex sample|
\end{enumerate}

Some journals e.g.~\texttt{journal=aog|jog|pasa} require Bib\TeX{}. For such journals, you will need to
\begin{itemize}
    \item delete the existing \verb|\addbibresource{example.bib}|;
    \item change the existing \verb|\printbibliography| to be \verb|\bibliography{example}| instead.
\end{itemize} 

Overleaf will run \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{bibtex} automatically as needed. But if you had \emph{first} compiled using another \texttt{journal} option that adopts \texttt{biblatex}, and \emph{then} change the \texttt{journal} option to one that adopts Bib\TeX{}, you may get some compile error messages instead. In this case you will need to do a `Recompile from scratch'; see \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Clearing_the_cache}.

On a local \LaTeX{} installation, you would need to run these steps instead:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Delete \texttt{sample.aux}, \texttt{sample.bbl} if these files from a previous compile using \texttt{biber} still exist.
    \item \verb|pdflatex sample|
    \item \verb|bibtex sample|
    \item \verb|pdflatex sample|
    \item \verb|pdflatex sample|
\end{enumerate}
